      is fully furnished with an eye for quality and detail throughout:</div><div>-
      firm, pillow-top queen bed with clean, fresh linens (sleeps 2 adults)</div><div>-

      &amp; pineapple sandwich. You can sit in the dining area or (email hidden).
      I prefer to (email hidden) and have an ice cold chopp (draft beer).<br>All calls
      to my Florida number are forwarded to my cellphone here in Rio. Be sure to let
      the call ring several times as there is a slight delay when forwarding calls
      to Brasil.</div>"
    body2: "<div>A five minute walk puts you on the sands of Copacabana beach, and
      the famous Copacabana Palace Hotel. Also close by are several excellent restaurants.
      Cervantes is a local favorite and highly recommended - try the filet mignon
      &amp; pineapple sandwich. You can sit in the dining area or (email hidden).
      I prefer to (email hidden) and have an ice cold chopp (draft beer).<br></div><div>Every
      Thursday there is an open-market across the street where they sell fresh fish,
      chicken, eggs, veggies and fruits of all kinds, flowers... just about anything
      you need. Also, there are several supermarkets to chose from within 5 minutes
      walking distance.</div><div>The hills surrounding the apartment are owned by
      the Brasilian Army. As such, the area has been protected from urban development
      for decades. This provides a calm, quiet environment and beautiful mountain
      views from the apartment.</div><div>A few homes have been built for officer
      housing but they are barely visible.</div><div>The metro station Cardial Arcoverde
      is only a three minute walk, putting all of Rio at your doorstep - Ipanema is
      less than 10 minutes by metro and Downtown/Lapa is less than 20 minutes away.</div><div>The
      building is safe and well-managed. A doorman is present 24 hours per day and
      we have closed-circuit TV in the hallways and elevators. With no stores or restaurants
      on the ground floor, it is clean and family-friendly.</div>"
