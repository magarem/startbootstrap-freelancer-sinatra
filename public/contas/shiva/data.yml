  body1: WE HAVE KNOWN FOR YEARS THAT ACAI IS A HEALTHFUL SUPERFOOD CONTAINING OMEGA
    FATTY ACIDS, DIETARY FIBER AND PHYTOSTEROLS, WHICH SUPPORT THE IMMUNE SYSTEM.
    MORE RECENTLY IT HAS BEEN DISCOVERED THAT THE BRAZILIAN GROWN BERRY IS ALSO ABUNDANT
    IN OXYGEN RADICAL ABSORBANCE CAPACITY (ORAC) UNITS, A MEASUREMENT FOR ANTIOXIDANTS
    DEVELOPED BY THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON AGING IN THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH
    (NIH). A HIGHER ORAC VALUE PROVIDES GREATER ANTIOXIDANT POWER. OUR DAILY REQUIREMENT
    IS ESTIMATED AT 3,000 TO 5,000 ORAC UNITS PER DAY.
